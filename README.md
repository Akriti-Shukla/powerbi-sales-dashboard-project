### 🎯 Key Objectives

1. **Connect and Profile the Data**  
   Imported and explored datasets including `sales`, `products`, `stores`, and `calendar` tables to understand schema, data quality, and key metrics.

2. **Create a Relational Model**  
   Established logical relationships between the tables using primary and foreign keys to form a star schema, ensuring optimized performance and accurate analysis.

3. **Add Calculated Measures and Fields**  
   Developed custom DAX measures and calculated columns to enhance data granularity, support business logic, and provide actionable KPIs (e.g. Total Orders, Total Revenue, Total Profit).

4. **Build an Interactive Report**  
   Designed a user-friendly and visually appealing Power BI report with dynamic filtering, drill-down capabilities, and key insights into sales performance across all store locations using slicers.
